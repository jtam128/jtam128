👋 Hi there! I am Jessica Tam, a web developer.

👀 I enjoy getting to see a product come to life from the lines of code that I write and making that product pleasing to the eye in the process.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web projects and open source development.

📫 How to reach me ... You can email me [here](mailto:jessica.tam128@gmail.com), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtam128/).
